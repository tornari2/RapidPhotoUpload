# Task ID: 27
# Title: Mobile Authentication System
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 19
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement JWT-based authentication for the React Native mobile app with integration to backend endpoints.
# Details:
1. Create `mobile-app/src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` to manage authentication state using React Context API.
2. Develop `mobile-app/src/screens/LoginScreen.tsx` for the login interface, ensuring it matches the modern dark theme with gradient buttons.
3. Develop `mobile-app/src/screens/RegisterScreen.tsx` for user registration, following the same UI guidelines.
4. Implement `mobile-app/src/services/authService.ts` to handle API calls for login, registration, and token refresh using existing backend endpoints.
5. Use `expo-secure-store` or `AsyncStorage` for secure token storage.
6. Implement logic to handle token refresh automatically.
7. Protect routes/screens by checking authentication state and redirecting unauthenticated users.
8. Add optional biometric authentication support using Face ID/Touch ID.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify authentication state management by logging in and checking token storage.
2. Test login and registration screens for UI consistency and functionality.
3. Ensure API integration by checking network requests during login, registration, and token refresh.
4. Test secure token storage and retrieval.
5. Validate protected routes by attempting access without authentication.
6. Test biometric authentication setup and fallback mechanisms.
