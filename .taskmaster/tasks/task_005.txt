# Task ID: 5
# Title: Async Configuration
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: medium
# Description: Configure Spring @Async for concurrent upload handling.
# Details:
Set up AsyncConfig with a fixed thread pool of 100 threads. Ensure proper handling of concurrent uploads.

Files to create/modify:

- Create: `backend/src/main/java/com/rapidphoto/infrastructure/config/AsyncConfig.java` for thread pool configuration.
- Modify: `backend/src/main/resources/application.properties` to add async thread pool settings.
- Create: `backend/src/test/java/com/rapidphoto/infrastructure/config/AsyncConfigTest.java` for unit tests.

# Test Strategy:
Load test with concurrent upload operations to verify thread pool configuration.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create AsyncConfig Class [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the AsyncConfig class to manage asynchronous operations.
### Details:
Create a new class named AsyncConfig in the configuration package.

## 2. Configure Thread Pool Executor [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Set up a thread pool executor with a fixed size of 100 threads.
### Details:
In AsyncConfig, configure a ThreadPoolTaskExecutor with a core pool size of 100.

## 3. Enable Async Support [done]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Enable asynchronous method execution in the application.
### Details:
Annotate the AsyncConfig class with @EnableAsync to enable async support.

## 4. Annotate Methods with @Async [done]
### Dependencies: 5.3
### Description: Identify and annotate methods that require asynchronous execution.
### Details:
Annotate relevant service methods with @Async to handle concurrent uploads.
<info added on 2025-11-07T22:29:23.560Z>
No controllers or service methods requiring @Async annotation exist yet. The AsyncConfig is ready, and when upload processing methods are created in controllers/services, they should be annotated with @Async to leverage the configured thread pool. The S3Service methods (generateUploadUrl, etc.) are synchronous and fast (just URL generation), so they don't need async execution.

## 5. Load Test Async Configuration [done]
### Dependencies: 5.2, 5.4
### Description: Perform load testing to verify the async configuration handles concurrent uploads.
### Details:
Conduct load testing using a tool like JMeter to simulate concurrent uploads and validate performance.
