# Task ID: 26
# Title: Frontend Authentication UI Implementation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 13, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop login and signup pages with form validation, error handling, and backend API integration.
# Details:
Create LoginPage and SignupPage components with forms for user input. Implement validation for fields such as username, password, and confirm password. Integrate with authService to handle API calls for user login and registration. Develop a ProtectedRoute component to ensure route protection, redirecting unauthenticated users to the login page. Implement navigation between login and signup pages and ensure automatic redirection to the dashboard upon successful authentication. Provide user feedback for validation errors and API call failures.

✅ COMPLETED: Frontend Authentication UI Implementation

Files Created/Modified:
- Created: web-app/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx (login form with username/password)
- Created: web-app/src/pages/SignupPage.tsx (signup form with username/password/confirm password)
- Created: web-app/src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx (route protection component)
- Modified: web-app/src/services/authService.ts (added register method)
- Modified: web-app/src/router/Router.tsx (added signup route and protected routes)
- Modified: web-app/src/App.tsx (removed login button from top navigation)

Backend Integration:
- Backend registration endpoint (/api/auth/register) was also implemented
- RegisterRequest DTO created
- AuthService.register() method added
- AuthController.register() endpoint added
- CORS updated to include port 5174

Features Implemented:
✅ Login page with form validation
✅ Signup page with password confirmation
✅ Client-side validation (username min 3 chars, password min 6 chars)
✅ Error handling and user feedback
✅ Automatic login after successful registration
✅ Route protection (redirects unauthenticated users to login)
✅ Navigation between login and signup pages
✅ Integration with AuthContext for state management
✅ JWT token storage in localStorage

Additional Improvements:
✅ Added redirect logic for authenticated users accessing login/signup pages
✅ Fixed TypeScript linting errors (replaced 'any' with proper error handling)
✅ Improved UX - prevents authenticated users from seeing login/signup forms

# Test Strategy:
Test form validation by entering invalid data and checking for appropriate error messages. Verify successful API integration by checking network requests during login and registration. Test route protection by attempting to access protected routes without authentication. Ensure navigation between login and signup pages works correctly. Confirm automatic redirection to the dashboard after successful login.
