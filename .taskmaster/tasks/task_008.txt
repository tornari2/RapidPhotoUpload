Files to create/modify:

- Create: `backend/src/main/java/com/rapidphoto/features/upload-status/UploadStatusController.java` for the SSE endpoint.
- Create: `backend/src/main/java/com/rapidphoto/features/upload-status/UploadStatusService.java` for SSE event management.
- Create: `backend/src/main/java/com/rapidphoto/features/upload-status/UploadStatusEvent.java` as the event DTO.
- Modify: `backend/src/main/java/com/rapidphoto/features/upload-photo/CompletePhotoUploadHandler.java` to emit SSE events.
- Modify: `backend/src/main/java/com/rapidphoto/features/upload-photo/FailPhotoUploadHandler.java` to emit SSE events.
- Create: `backend/src/test/java/com/rapidphoto/features/upload-status/UploadStatusIntegrationTest.java` for integration testing.

# Test Strategy:
Test SSE event emission and client reconnection logic.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Design SSE Endpoint Architecture [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design the architecture for the SSE endpoint to handle real-time status updates.
### Details:
Outline the structure and flow of the SSE endpoint, including how it will interact with the existing system components.

## 2. Implement SSE Endpoint Using SseEmitter [done]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop the SSE endpoint using SseEmitter to emit events on photo status changes.
### Details:
Use Spring's SseEmitter to create an endpoint that maintains a persistent connection and emits events when photo statuses change.

## 3. Integrate SSE Endpoint with Photo Status Updates [done]
### Dependencies: 8.2
### Description: Connect the SSE endpoint to the photo status update mechanism.
### Details:
Ensure that the SSE endpoint listens for changes in photo status and emits the appropriate events to connected clients.

## 4. Implement Client Reconnection Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 8.3
### Description: Develop logic to handle client reconnections to the SSE endpoint.
### Details:
Ensure that clients can reconnect to the SSE endpoint seamlessly in case of disconnections.

## 5. Deploy and Monitor SSE Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: 8.4
### Description: Deploy the SSE endpoint to the production environment and monitor its performance.
### Details:
Deploy the endpoint and set up monitoring to track its performance and reliability in real-time.
